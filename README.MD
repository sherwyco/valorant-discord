# Deprecation Notice
## Valorant now shows the player's current rank rating (RR) thus I wont be developing this project futher.

Simple Valorant bot for discord made with MongoDB, Express, NodeJS that shows your rank, elo, match history. More features will be added in the future.

To run, clone the repository and create `.env` file in the root folder and add the following variables

`DATABASE_URL=<your_mongodb_url>`

`DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_token>`

`DISCORD_PREFIX=<your_discord_bot_prefix>`

`DOMAIN_URL=http://localhost:3000` make sure theres no trailing `/` at the end of your domain url.

after, run `npm run dev` for development mode and `npm start` for production.
